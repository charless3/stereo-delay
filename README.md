# stereo-delay
This stereo delay plugin was written with the JUCE (v5.0.2) library.

It has four main parameters: delay time (msecs), feedback (%), mix (%), and bypass. The feedback parameter specifies the amount of audio processor output to add back into the input. The mix parameter specifies the ratio of input signal (dry) to output/delayed signal (wet). The bypass parameter can be used to turn off the effect.
